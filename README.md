# Projects
Some personal projects I coded 

-Demineur : A little program that can generate a grid of minesweeper and play using commands. I never implemented the GUI that would go with it

-Blind : A GUI that generate random Rubik's cube scrambles and can go from one to the next. The original idea was to implement also a way for "blind cubers" (people who try to solve the cube while blindfolded) to setup their mnemonics pattern, and give the solution to what they should have memorized for each solve. However the GUI works I never finished it.

-BTLED : arduino project that controls my LEDs. Works with a Bluetooth ESP32 module. An app I coded on my phone sends the right messages for the Arduino to interpret.
